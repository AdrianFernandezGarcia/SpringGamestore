# SpringGamestore
This is a web application that can be use for managing a Videogame Store. The app has being developed using Java and Spring Framework for the back-end.
For the front-end I´ve used HTML with Thymeleaf Templates, CSS and JavaScript.

In order to execute the application the following tools are needed:
<ul> 
<li> IntelliJ Idea </li>
<li> Maven </li>
</ul>

Once the app is running on IntelliJ, just type localhost:{port} on your browser bar. The port will be provided by Spring, and I´ll be shown in the console, as it´s shown below:
